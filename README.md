Module 1.1 - ArrayLists (Uni work)
==================================

“You are asked to create your own list including at least 5 items you bought in
the last week.”

The video discusses everything in Java but you need to use C++ to write your own
solution.

Notes
-----

Array can expand as needed.

Duplicates allowed.

Indexed, add/remove elements by index.

 

Difficulty:

-   In the language I learned; Haxe, Arrays can dynamically change size or be at
    a fixed size depending on how it’s created, so it was a surprise that Arrays
    in C++ are only fixed size.

-   I only recently started learning C++.

-   The task only specifies creating “your own list of including at least 5
    items”, does not specify if you need to create a List or a ArrayList data
    type.  
    The task links to a video about Array Lists, but does not specify whether or
    not to use it.

-   In Haxe, it is easy to get the length of the array by getting
    arrayOfThings.length
